Cool injector for Windows ia32 (for now) process/dll. Mostly of manual map and virtual loadlibrary codes were ported and fixed from stuffs made for VC10 to GCC5. <br />
All credits from ported codes were on commentaries inside the code :)<br />
Some really cool stuffs resides commented, because I didn't want to use it right now. Others are commented because I forgot to remove it.

Build tips:<br />
1. Its depends on QT5 to be build, so remember to fixup project toolchains!!  
2. All *.s must be added to linkage by qmake automatically.
