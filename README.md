Kindly Injector

Simple injector for Windows ia32 process/dll. Mostly of manual map and virtual loadlibrary codes were ported and fixed from stuffs made for VC10 to GCC5.
All credits for ported codes were at commentaries inside code :)
Some really cool stuffs resides commented, because I didn't want to use it right now. 
Its depends on QT5 to be build!!
